Instructions:
-To see text output using EasyOCR print the variable that stores the text ("text_extracted")  
-Tesseract doesnt have easy bounding box plotting, so I'll be working on that to also include that for comparison -- stay posted 


Results:
-Text Extraction Confidence Results (avergae confidence fo all words extracted): 
    Output from "tesseract_noOpenCV.py" file without any image preprocessing before text extraction:
        arithmetic document: Average Confidence Score: 0.4013407474322169
        tabular document: Average Confidence Score: 0.6593349050505051
        structured text document: Average Confidence Score: 0.36913806917293235

    Output from "tesseract_OpenCV.py" file with image preprocessing before text extraction:
        tabular document: Average Confidence Score: 0.8009603495951416
        arithemtic document: Average Confidence Score: nan (no text wa ssucessfully extracted)
        structured text document: Average Confidence Score: 0.26890476315789474
-I'm not sure how good these confidence metrics are, as for the tabualted log book 
the confidence score is relatively high, but if you print the extracted_text output, it's
very scrambled and hard to read and doesn't reflect the data entries on the image well....
