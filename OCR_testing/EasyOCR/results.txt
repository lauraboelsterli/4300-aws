Instructions:
-To see text output using EasyOCR print the variable that stores the text ("text_extracted")  
(aka where the readtext method is called on reader object), e.g., extracted_text = reader.readtext(img) (in "easyocr_noOpenCV.py" file)
-To see bounding boxes and text extracted from the bounding boxes, simply run the "easyocr_noOpenCV.py" 
and "easyocr_noOpenCV.py" files and the plot with the images will show up.


Results:
-Text Extraction Confidence Results (precalculated metric by EasyOCR): 
    Output from "easyocr_noOpenCV.py" file without any image preprocessing before text extraction:
        arithmetic document: Average Confidence Score: 0.3633284060333953
        tabular document: Average Confidence Score: 0.35610189251621827
        structured text document: Average Confidence Score: 0.26978130216375

    Output from "easyocr_OpenCV.py" file with image preprocessing before text extraction:
        tabular document: Average Confidence Score: 0.4293633125261525
        arithemtic document: Average Confidence Score: 0.34937963490073437
        structured text document: Average Confidence Score: 0.2858997759862364
-preprocessing only helped with the tabular document, though confidence score is still low
