Instructions:
-to see the results run the files and see the images and text extraction or print the text extracted. There's no precalculated 
confidence metric calculated with the keras-ocr library

Results:
-results are not great and highly inaccurate ( I can infer even wihtout a confidence 
score based on the plotted images and illegibility of the extracted text), probably as 
im using a pretrained model for this text extraction test in 
"keras_OpenCVpretrained.py" and "keras_noOpenCVpretrained"
-image preprocessing didn't help much 

therefore, 
next steps with keras:
I found some documentation where someone did handwriting extraction and trained the model on a handwirting dataset:
I'll follow these steps: https://keras.io/examples/vision/handwriting_recognition/ 
and will use this handwritten text database to try to build an ocr model with keras
