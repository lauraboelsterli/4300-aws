Lowell discusses the interpretation of the images, noting that they were validated by similar observations made using a telescope. He mentions the support of prominent astronomers like Mr. Ricker and Mr. Eddington, who agree with the observations and interpretations. The observations challenge the current scientific positions held in England, suggesting that further verification might come from recent images acquired in America.",
